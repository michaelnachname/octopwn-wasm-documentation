# SMBLAPS Scanner

The **SMBLAPS Scanner** validates a single **LAPS (Local Administrator Password Solution)** admin user against all hosts in a provided LAPS dump file. This scanner is useful for verifying if dumped LAPS credentials are still valid or identifying the correct local admin username for the target system. 

This scanner requires a **LAPS dump file** containing hostnames and their corresponding local admin passwords in the format `hostname:password`.
## Use Cases

### Credential Validation
- Check if stale LAPS entries are still valid or have been rotated.
- Validate whether the provided local admin username matches the dumped LAPS password.

### Stale Credential Detection
- Identify whether LAPS passwords in the dump file are outdated or no longer functional.

### Identify Correct Local Admin Username
- Use the scanner to test and confirm the correct local administrator username for the specified host.
