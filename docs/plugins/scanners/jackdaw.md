# Jackdaw Scanner plugin

## Features
- LDAP enumeration
- SMB enumeration

## Description

The **Jackdaw Scanner** in OctoPwn performs comprehensive LDAP and SMB enumeration in an Active Directory (AD) environment. It gathers extensive information about users, groups, computers, organizational units (OUs), and their associated security descriptors. Jackdaw also enumerates SMB sessions and shares. All collected data is stored in a SQLite database, enabling detailed analysis of domain object interactions and potential attack paths. This scanner is akin to BloodHoundâ€™s ingestor but generates a different output format focused on broad enumeration and data correlation.
