# SMBProto Scanner 

The **SMBProto Scanner** is similar to the **SMBSig Scanner** but provides additional information on supported smb dialects. This scanner requires 5-6 connection attempts to complete its operations, making it slower than SMBSig. 

If you are only interested in checking SMB signing, it is recommended to use the [SMBSig Scanner](smbsig.html) instead.
