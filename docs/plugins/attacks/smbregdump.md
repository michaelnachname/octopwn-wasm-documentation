# SMBRegDump Attack

The **SMBRegDump Attack** leverages the **Remote Registry Service** on Windows systems to remotely access and dump registry hives over SMB. These hives are dumped onto disk on the remote system and is then parsed remotely to extract the SAM, SYSTEM and SECURITY secrets, such as local account hashes. If local account hashes are extracted successfully, they will be automatically added in the credentials window of OctoPwn for further lateral movement steps.

Specifies the ID of the credential to use for authentication on the target. This needs to be a local admin.
