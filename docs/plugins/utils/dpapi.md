This utility performs DPAPI related functions.  

## Deep-dive

In order to decrpyt a file/blob/data of any kind you must obtain a masterkey.
The Masterkey can be obtained either from the LSASS process, or by decrypting a masterkeyfile. LSASS is straightforward, successfully dumping it will give you all the plaintext masterkeys with the appropriate GUID.

But if you can't use LSASS, you have to obtain the masterkey file, and decrypt it with an appropriate key. (too many keys, I know...)

Masterkey files can be located in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Protect\%SID%` for each user or `%SYSTEMDIR%\Microsoft\Protect` for the SYSTEM user. But how to decrypt them?

A masterkeyfile can contain multiple different keys, a masterkey is one of them. The masterkey is stored encrypted in the masterkeyfile, and is encrypted with a key that can be either a key stored in registry (LSA secrets) or not. In case the LSA DPAPI keys are not valid, you will need to use the NT hash of the user's password or the user's plaintext password itself. BUT! deriving the key from the password and the SID will yield 3 different keys, and so far noone could tell what key is the correct one to be used.

The solution for decrypting a masterkey in the mastereky file: harvest as many key candidates as possible and try to decrypt the masterkey. Much to our luck, verifying the signature data after decryption can tell us if the decrpytion was successful, so we can tell if the masterkey decrypted correctly or not.

But you may ask: I see a lot of different masterkey files, how can I tell which one is used for my `<credential file/vault files/blob>`. The answer: a masterkeyfile stores the GUID of the keys it stores (eg. the masterkey), and so does your `<secret>` data structure for the appropriate key. Therefore it's easy to tell which file to decrypt for a given `<secret>`.

BUT WAIT! THERE IS MORE!

DPAPI is also used to decrypt stored secrets in Windows Vault and Credential files.

### Credential files:

1. standalone file, inside it there is a DPAPI_BLOB.
2. DPAPI_BLOB can be decrypted with the corresponding masterkey
3. After decryption you'll find a CREDENTIAL_BLOB structure.
4. The CREDENTIAL_BLOB structure has the plain-text secrets, but it's not possible to tell in which file they are stored. You'll need to check them by hand :)

### Vault files (VCRD and VPOL)

VCRD files hold the secrets encrypted. The decryption key is stored in the VPOL file, but also encrypted. The VPOL file's decryption key is a masterkey. The masterkey is stored in a Masterkeyfile...
	
1. Need to find the masterkey to decrypt the VPOL file
2. VPOL file will give two keys after successful decryption
3. There is no way to tell (atm) which key will be the correct one to decrypt the VCRD file
4. The VCRD file has a lot of stored secrets, called attributes. Each attribute is encrypted with one of the keys from the VPOL file
5. For each attribute: for each key: decrypt attribute.
6. Check manually if one of them succeeded because there are no integrity checks, so no way to tell programatically which key worked.

### Path to decrypt stuff

Sub-sections are options of how to get the keys

1. pre_masterkey:
	- from user password and SID
	- from user NT hash and SID
	- from live registry SYSTEM cached DPAPI key or SAM cache NT hash and SID
	-  from offline registry hives
	
2. masterkey:
	- from masterkeyfile + pre_masterkey
	- from live LSASS dump
	- from offline LSASS dump
	
3. credential file:
	- masterkey + credential_file
	
3. VPOL file:
	- masterkey + VPOL file
	
3. VCRED file:
	- VPOL file + VCRED file
	
3. DPAPI_BLOB:
	- masterkey


## Tips

All `pre-key` and `masterkey` data will be automatically cached in the session to help you in the secrets extraction phase.  

To perform any meaningful decryption, first you will need to generate `pre-keys`, except if you have already decrypted masterkey secrets in the form of LSASS dump or you are a wizard Harry and from some unknown source you managed to get the keys (pls let me know how).  

You can get `pre-keys` by either using user SID and password or NT hash. Chances are that you have some `pre-key` material already stored in the `Credentials Window` in this case just smash the `loadcreds` button. In case you have some not stored creds, use the commands in the `PREKEY` command group.  

Now that you have `pre-keys` you can grab a `Masterkey file` and try to decrypt the `masterkey` using the `masterkeys` or `masterkey` command. The former will automatically search all masterkey files and try to decrypt if with all the `pre-keys` cached from before. In case you have successfully decrypted a masterkey the key will be cached.  

If you have masterkeys cached, then you can try to decrypt some actual secrets with the other command groups.  Those commands do not need any masterkey specification because the blobs they are decrypting already contain the masterkey's ID which will be looked up in the hidden cache.
