# DCEDRSUAPI Client 
DRSUAPI allows you to perform a DCSync, without the use of SMB.  
This has the benefit of not touching port 445 on the domain controller, but the tradeoff is that you won't get any automatization. This means you will need to know the domain and username to you want to target for a dcsync attack.
## Features
